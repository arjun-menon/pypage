Hi,

How are you, Alice?

I heard you went snowboarding.

Here is a nice pattern:
    1 -> a
    1 -> b
    1 -> c
    2 -> a
    2 -> b
    2 -> c
    3 -> a
    3 -> b
    3 -> c

And here's an ode to you:

    aaaaa
    eeeee
    iiiii
    ooooo
    uuuuu

That is: 
  a
  e
  i
  o
  u
Best,
Alice
